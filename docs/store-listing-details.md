## Press Release Draft

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**New Mobile App Generates Cryptographically Secure Passwords in Under 300ms**

*SecurePass Generator launches with biometric protection and complete offline functionality*

[LOCATION] - SecurePass Generator, a new mobile application for password creation, launches today on iOS and Android platforms. The app generates cryptographically secure passwords in under 300 milliseconds while maintaining complete user privacy through offline operation.

Key features include biometric authentication, customizable password templates, and real-time strength analysis. Unlike cloud-based password managers, SecurePass Generator operates entirely offline, ensuring user data never leaves their device.

The app uses expo-crypto's cryptographically secure random number generation and follows OWASP mobile application security verification standards. A comprehensive security audit was completed before launch.

SecurePass Generator is available free with optional $1.99 ad removal. Download links and more information are available at securepass-generator.app.
